# AwSW Casual Vandalism

This isnt supposed to be a proper AwSW mod, it was more me seeing if I was able to mod, so dont expect anything amazing.

The basic idea is that the parts of Lorem's 3rd date is changed. Aswell as small parts of chapter 4 and his 4th date.
(Assuming the mod is working properly) It should start when the MC and Lorem start walking to the school area for the tresure hunt.
There will be two options, picking one will change one of the later sceans and the other will have the normal route.
If you picked the option that changes the route you should pick "Look inside the windows." and you will have another two options with diffrent dialoge.

Also in this new, (and slightly) improved version, you can smash a second window, Seb and Bryce comment on you smashing the window and Lorem also comments on said earlier second window being smashed.

This needs Magmalink to work, which can be found here: https://gitlab.com/jakzie2/awsw-magmalink

Also huge thanks to Jakzie for their help, they're the reason this actually works and isnt just error screen after error screen.
